### Elevator Pitch: 
Haptic AI allows inside sales representatives to leverage the power of machine learning to increase response rates on outbound communication, by using a gamified, 4-step feedback loop that takes less than 15 seconds per touchpoint to complete.

### Feature Overview:  
The application will load a contact list of prospects, sort that list by expected value (deal size + response rate + close rate), display a prospect profile when prompted, facilitate outreach (phone, email, or social media), prompt the rep to score the results of the touchpoint, and display a leaderboard/scoreboard. 

* <small>(sorted)</small> Contact List
* Prospect Profile
* Feedback Page
* Leaderboard/Scoreboard

The project is a web application called Haptic AI that feeds Sales Reps  a list of "next steps" or "actions" that are most profitable (i.e. have the highest expected value). Devon Luongo is working on a deep learning algorithm for a Next Gen CRM/SalesForce that increases response rates by leveraging data stored in Marketing Automation and Sales Force. The Data Science portion is an ongoing effort, so this will simply be the CRM/SalesForce front end tool. The algorithm itself outputs a “score”, so we can easily mock this in our schema. 

From a user perspective, a Sales Rep opens up a dashboard. They see a sorted list of all their sales targets. Clicking on a particular prospect (line item) fires up a customer profile, call/email template, etc. After the call/email is placed, each rep has an opportunity to quickly log the quality and outcome of the touchpoint. This loop models the behavior of inside sales and outbound telesales reps. The goal is to increase response rates. 

### Goal:
The goal of the Haptic AI project is to create a system with a fully functional tool ready to be used in Market Research and to secure funding. A milestone of this goal (the web application tool) serves as the final project for the CSCI E-56 class. This web application would set up the fundamental database architecture for the traditional CRM and use a modular approach which can enhance the feedback loop process described above.
